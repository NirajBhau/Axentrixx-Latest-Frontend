## Why Migrate to the Cloud?

Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency that on-premise servers simply cannot match. For growing businesses, migrating to the cloud is often the first step towards digital transformation.

## The 6 Rs of Migration

1.  **Rehost** (Lift and shift)
2.  **Replatform** (Lift, tinker, and shift)
3.  **Repurchase** (Drop and shop)
4.  **Refactor** (Re-architecting)
5.  **Retire** (Get rid of)
6.  **Retain** (Do nothing)
