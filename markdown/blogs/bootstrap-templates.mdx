## The AI Revolution

Business Intelligence (BI) has always been about making data-driven decisions. However, with the integration of Artificial Intelligence, BI is shifting from descriptive analytics (what happened) to predictive and prescriptive analytics (what will happen and how to make it happen).

## Automating Insights

AI algorithms can process vast amounts of unstructured data—emails, documents, images—that traditional BI tools couldn't handle. This provides a holistic view of business performance and customer sentiment.
